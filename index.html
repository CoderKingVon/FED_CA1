                Climate change is an extremely worrying issue that many seems to acknowledge but
                minimal actions were taken by people to tackle this problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                Hence, the <abbr title = "Sustainable Development Goals">SDG</abbr> was born 
                with the aim to transform the world, one of its target being
                to protect the world in general.
                </p>
                <p>
                To learn how the <abbr title = "United Nations">UN</abbr> has taken actions
                against climate change, we must first equip ourselves with the basic fundamentals and learn the 
                consequences of climate change.

                <p>One of the more unknown impacts of climate change is its 
                    <strong>impact on the economy of the world</strong>. People often overlook how it
                    would affect the economy and shift their focus more on the environment.
                </p>
                <p>Below are some of the sectors that climate change will <strong>affect adversely</strong>:</p>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    1. Agriculture is the most vulnerable and sensitve to climate change. As a result,
                    food security is also threatened as well as revenue from this sector.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. Infrastructure is at risk from being damaged from increased flooding due
                    to rising sea levels.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. Tourism is affected due to increased pollution and flooding. Which, in general,
                    makes places less attractive for people to visit.

                    In simple terms, global warming is the long-term warming of the planet’s overall
                    temperature. This rate of warming has <strong>significantly increased</strong> over the years due to
                    higher usage of fossil fuels. <span class = "factory">&#127981;</span>

                Most electricity is still generated by burning coal, oil, or gas, which produces carbon dioxide and <strong>nitrous oxide 
                – powerful greenhouse gases</strong> that blanket the Earth and trap the sun’s heat.

                <p>Sea level rise is an <strong>increase in the level of the world’s oceans</strong> due to the <strong>effects of global warming</strong>.
                   This means that the <strong>total volume of waters in the ocean has increased</strong>, and the average depth of the sea has
                   increased.

                <p>
                    Sea level rise is caused primarily by two factors related to global warming:

                    <br>
                    (i) The added water from melting ice sheets and glaciers
                    <br>
                    (ii) The expansion of seawater as it warms.

                    <h2>Melting Glaciers</h2>
                    <h3>How Does Melting Glaciers Cause Sea Levels to Rise?</h3>
                    <p>
                        But as temperatures continue to rise because of heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions, 
                        glaciers are likely to melt even more quickly. This means that, 
                        in the event of a glacial lake outburst, it would <strong>unleash a larger quantity of water.</strong>
                    </p>
                <h2>Thermal Expansion</h2>
                    <h3>How does the rise in temperature cause sea level to rise?</h3>
                    <p>Let's break down the term: Thermal Expansion</p>
                    <p>
                        A fitting synonym for thermal would be heat.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Expansions refers to the increase in volume of an object.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By piecing the words together, you can see that the heat emitted
                        by global warming can cause an increase in volume of the ocean, causing 
                        sea levels to rise.

                        Extreme heat is <strong>deadly</strong>. During a heatwave, the number of

                    <p>
                        More than 61,000 people died as a result of searing heat 
                        across Europe in the summer of 2022. And a recent

                        found that more than one-third of all heat-related

                        Cold temperatures are a bigger problem than hot. <strong>But with climate change, hot 
                        temperatures will be more and more serious.</strong>

                        caused by “non optimal temperatures”, 
                        with about <strong>89 per cent</strong> of those being cold-related. But the trends are shifting in 
                        the region, with heat-related deaths on the rise.

                        Climate change can also affect indoor air quality. 
                        Increases in outside air pollutants, such as ozone 
                        and particulate matter, could lead to higher indoor 
                        exposures. These pollutants can enter a building in 
                        many ways, including through open doors and windows 
                        and ventilation systems.

                        Additionally, Indoor air pollutants have been linked to heart disease,
